    My mom said: "Honney, please go to the market and buy 1 bottle of milk. If they have eggs, bring 6"

    I came back with 6 bottles of milk.

    She said: "Why the hell did you buy 6 bottles of milk?"

        20. Hmm...That's weird... <br>
        19. It's never done that before. <br>
        18. It worked yesterday. <br>
        17. How is that possible? <br>
        16. It must be a hardware problem. <br>
        15. What did you type in wrong to get it to crash? <br>
        14. There has to be something funky in your data. <br>
        13. I haven't touched that module in weeks! <br>
        12. You must have the wrong version. <br>
        11. It's just some unlucky coincidence. <br>
        10. I can't test everything! <br>
        9. THIS can't be the source of THAT. <br>
        8. It works, but it hasn't been tested. <br>
        7. Somebody must have changed my code. <br>
        6. Did you check for a virus on your system? <br>
        5. Even though it doesn't work, how does it feel? <br>
        4. You can't use that version on your system. <br>
        3. Why do you want to do it that way? <br>
        2. Where were you when the program blew up? <br>
        1. It works on my machine.
