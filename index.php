        6. Did you check for a virus on your system? <br>
        5. Even though it doesn't work, how does it feel? <br>
        4. You can't use that version on your system. <br>
        3. Why do you want to do it that way? <br>
        2. Where were you when the program blew up? <br>
        1. It works on my machine.
